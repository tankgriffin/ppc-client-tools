# Phase 5: SEO Content Strategy and Keyword Research

Based on the strategic positioning developed in Phase 4, I need you to create a comprehensive content strategy and keyword research plan for SEO success.

## Strategic Foundation:
- **Business**: Pivotal180
- **Industry**: Course Provider
- **Target Audience**: Pivotal180’s primary target audience is finance and investment professionals working in renewable energy, infrastructure, critical minerals, and tax equity sectors. This includes analysts, associates, and managers at investment banks, private equity firms, project developers, utilities, and advisory firms, as well as government agencies and corporates involved in large-scale project financing. They also target organisations seeking to upskill entire teams through customised in-house training, along with universities and professional bodies looking to provide accredited, industry-relevant education.
- **Primary Goal**: Lead Generation
- **Budget Range**: $2500-$5000
- **Unique Value**: Pivotal180 stands out for combining deep, real-world transaction experience with a teaching style designed to be both practical and engaging. Unlike many training providers that focus on theory, their instructors have worked on major renewable energy, infrastructure, and tax equity deals, so the content reflects current industry practices and challenges. They also bridge the gap between education and execution by offering both training and hands-on advisory, audit, and transaction support. The mix of delivery formats—self-paced, live public, and fully customised in-house—ensures clients receive learning tailored to their needs. Their CPD accreditation and global reach further set them apart, positioning them as both a trusted educator and an active industry partner.
