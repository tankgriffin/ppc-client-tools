Offer time-limited audits or bonuses for paid consults to filter quality leads

Summary of Actionable PPC Insights
Target Shopify and conversion keywords competitors are ignoring

Use Meta Ads to differentiate via storytelling (e.g. Rocket Fuel, client transformations)

Position as strategic partner, not just a service provider

Run comparison-style campaigns (e.g. “Before vs After” site performance)
