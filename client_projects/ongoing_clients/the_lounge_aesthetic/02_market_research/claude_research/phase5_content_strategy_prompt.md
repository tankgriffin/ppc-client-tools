# Phase 5: Integrated Content Strategy for PPC + SEO

Based on the strategic positioning developed in Phase 4, I need you to create a comprehensive content strategy that maximizes synergies between PPC campaigns and SEO efforts.

## Strategic Foundation:
- **Business**: The Lounge Aesthetic
- **Industry**: Cosmetic Clinic
- **Target Audience**: The Lounge Aesthetics primarily targets women aged 25 to 55 who value subtle, high-quality cosmetic enhancements and are seeking a trusted, long-term clinic relationship. Their audience includes professionals, busy mums, and appearance-conscious individuals who prioritise natural results, safety, and clinical expertise over cheap or high-volume treatments.This audience is typically informed, discerning, and wellness-oriented, often researching treatments beforehand and expecting personalised care, premium service, and a boutique experience. They're looking for preventative and corrective aesthetic treatments that help them feel confident and refreshed—without appearing “overdone.”
- **Primary Goal**: Lead Generation
- **Budget Range**: $1000-$2500
- **Unique Value**: The Lounge Aesthetics stands out for its personalised, clinical approach that balances advanced cosmetic science with a strong emphasis on natural-looking results. Unlike high-volume chain clinics, they offer longer, one-on-one consultations to understand each client’s goals and design customised treatment plans. Every procedure is performed by experienced cosmetic nurses who prioritise safety, education, and ethical standards.What also makes them unique is their boutique atmosphere, which fosters a more relaxed, private experience—far from the rushed feel of larger clinics. Their ongoing commitment to clinical training and using the latest technology ensures clients receive evidence-based care with consistently high-quality outcomes.
