# Phase 6: SEO Foundation and Technical Integration

Building on the integrated content strategy, I need you to develop the SEO technical foundation that will support coordinated PPC and SEO performance.

## Strategic Foundation:
- **Business**: The Lounge Aesthetic
- **Industry**: Cosmetic Clinic
- **Website**: https://theloungeaesthetics.com.au/
- **Target Audience**: The Lounge Aesthetics primarily targets women aged 25 to 55 who value subtle, high-quality cosmetic enhancements and are seeking a trusted, long-term clinic relationship. Their audience includes professionals, busy mums, and appearance-conscious individuals who prioritise natural results, safety, and clinical expertise over cheap or high-volume treatments.This audience is typically informed, discerning, and wellness-oriented, often researching treatments beforehand and expecting personalised care, premium service, and a boutique experience. They're looking for preventative and corrective aesthetic treatments that help them feel confident and refreshed—without appearing “overdone.”
- **Primary Goal**: Lead Generation
