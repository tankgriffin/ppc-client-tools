# Phase 7: Advanced SEO Content Strategy and Link Building

Building on the technical foundation, I need you to develop an advanced SEO content strategy and authority building plan that complements and amplifies the integrated PPC efforts.

## Strategic Foundation:
- **Business**: The Lounge Aesthetic
- **Industry**: Cosmetic Clinic
- **Target Audience**: The Lounge Aesthetics primarily targets women aged 25 to 55 who value subtle, high-quality cosmetic enhancements and are seeking a trusted, long-term clinic relationship. Their audience includes professionals, busy mums, and appearance-conscious individuals who prioritise natural results, safety, and clinical expertise over cheap or high-volume treatments.This audience is typically informed, discerning, and wellness-oriented, often researching treatments beforehand and expecting personalised care, premium service, and a boutique experience. They're looking for preventative and corrective aesthetic treatments that help them feel confident and refreshed—without appearing “overdone.”
- **Primary Goal**: Lead Generation
- **Budget Range**: $1000-$2500
