Ideal for businesses with traction but lacking a system to scale

2. Positioning Pillars
Pillar	Supporting Evidence	Differentiation	Relevance
Performance First	Rocket Fuel process, proven ROI results	Most agencies focus on aesthetics; Five by Five delivers revenue impact	Appeals to growth-focused businesses
Strategic Clarity	Brand messaging and funnel planning built-in	Others only offer technical builds or patchwork marketing	Simplifies complexity for time-poor founders/marketers
Shopify & Service Expertise	Extensive Shopify work + B2B lead-gen sites	Few balance eComm + service sector	Matches dual audience segments
Fast, Frictionless Delivery	Tight processes, positive client reviews	Contrast to freelancer delays or bloated agency timelines	Removes a major decision barrier
Local Trust, Global Execution	Gold Coast base + national reach	Combines personal service with scalable systems	Ideal for AU businesses wanting reliable execution

3. Messaging Architecture

“Your website shouldn’t just look great. It should grow your business.”

Secondary Supporting Messages

“We turn digital confusion into clarity—and clicks into customers.”

“A proven process. No guesswork. Just results.”

“Shopify and service websites built for performance, not just polish.”

Audience-Specific Variations

eCommerce: “Tired of your Shopify store not converting? We’ll fix it fast—with ROI in mind.”

Service Firms: “You’re not just selling a service. You’re selling trust. We build websites that earn it.”

Emotional vs. Rational Balance

Emotional Hooks: Frustration, relief, trust, ambition (“Finally—an agency that gets it.”)

Rational Drivers: ROI, process, conversion uplift, clear reporting

4. Competitive Positioning
Positioning Against Main Competitors

Scenario-Based Positioning

SEO-first competitor: “We optimise everything—from search to sale.”
