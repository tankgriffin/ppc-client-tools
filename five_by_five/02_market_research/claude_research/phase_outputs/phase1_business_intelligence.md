# Phase1 Business Intelligence

1. Market Position Assessment
Industry Landscape Analysis
The Australian digital agency space is mature but highly fragmented, with many small-to-mid-tier agencies competing for local business.

Shopify design and eCommerce builds are experiencing increased demand post-COVID, particularly in Australia’s retail and product sectors.

Business Maturity & Growth Potential

Their strategic positioning around conversion and performance sets them up well for continued growth.

With their focus on results over aesthetics, they appeal to serious businesses, not budget DIYers.

Market Opportunity Size
Queensland alone has over 400,000 active businesses, with 97% being small businesses—many of which are potential customers.

Nationally, the opportunity is even larger, especially as remote delivery has become standard.
