## Context
You are analyzing all available client research and account data to generate a comprehensive, customized 6-month testing framework. Use the Enhanced Testing Framework as your methodology base while adapting every element to {client_name}'s specific competitive advantages, market opportunities, and business context.

## Available Data Sources
All client analysis files are available in the `claude_code_analysis/` directory:

### Critical Analysis Files

## üöÄ Ready to Generate Custom Testing Framework

### Files Prepared for Analysis
- **Client Brief**: `client_analysis_brief.md` - Complete client context
- **Claude Prompt**: `claude_code_prompt.md` - Detailed analysis instructions
- **Reference Framework**: `../Ads Testing Framework.md` - Base methodology
- **Client Data**: Organized in subfolders for easy access

### Claude Code Execution Steps

#### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd {client_name}/

# Verify Claude Code can access the analysis directory
ls claude_code_analysis/
```

#### 2. Load Context in Claude Code
Start Claude Code and provide this context:

**Primary Instruction:**
"I need you to analyze all client research data and generate a custom 6-month testing framework. Please start by reading and analyzing these files in order:

1. `claude_code_analysis/client_analysis_brief.md` - For complete client context
2. `claude_code_analysis/claude_code_prompt.md` - For detailed analysis instructions  
3. `claude_code_analysis/business_intel/` - For business goals and positioning
4. `claude_code_analysis/market_research/` - For competitive analysis and market gaps
5. `claude_code_analysis/account_structure/` - For current performance context
6. `Ads Testing Framework.md` - For base methodology reference

Then generate a comprehensive custom testing framework following the detailed requirements in the prompt file."

#### 3. Analysis Process
Claude Code will:
- Parse all client research and account data
- Identify top competitive advantages and market opportunities
- Generate 10-15 specific testing hypotheses
- Create customized 6-month implementation timeline
- Provide campaign structure and creative strategy recommendations

#### 4. Expected Output
**File**: `{client_name}_Custom_Testing_Framework_[Date].md`
**Length**: 10-15 pages of actionable strategy
**Sections**:
- Executive Summary
- Competitive Advantage Analysis  
- Testing Hypothesis Library
- 6-Month Implementation Timeline
- Campaign Strategy Recommendations
- Measurement Framework
- Risk Management Plan

### Quality Validation
Before implementing, verify the framework includes:
- [ ] Specific competitive advantages identified from research
- [ ] Market gaps translated into testable hypotheses
- [ ] Timeline adapted to client's context and constraints
- [ ] Campaign recommendations based on account structure analysis
- [ ] Success metrics aligned with client business goals

### Next Steps After Framework Generation
1. **Review and Validate**: Check framework against client research
2. **Refine if Needed**: Ask Claude Code to adjust specific sections
3. **Implementation Planning**: Begin campaign setup based on Month 1 recommendations
4. **Team Alignment**: Share framework with campaign management team
5. **Tracking Setup**: Implement measurement framework before campaign launch

### Troubleshooting
**If Claude Code can't access files:**
- Verify file paths are correct
- Check that all analysis files were copied properly
- Ensure Claude Code has permission to read the directory

**If output lacks client specificity:**
- Emphasize the requirement to cite specific research insights
- Ask for more detailed competitive advantage analysis
- Request specific examples from the client's market research

**If timeline seems generic:**
- Provide additional context about client's budget and volume
- Emphasize adaptation to client's industry and seasonality
- Request more specific monthly implementation details
