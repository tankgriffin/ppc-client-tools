# Ultra-Streamlined Testing Framework for Claude Code

## Framework Overview
Generate focused, actionable testing frameworks with only essential strategic elements. Maximum 4-5 pages total output.

## Required Output Structure

### Section 1: Executive Summary (1 page max)
```markdown
# [Client Name] - Custom 6-Month Testing Framework

**Generated**: [Date]
**Client**: [Client Name and Business Description]

## Primary Competitive Advantages
1. **[Advantage 1]** - [Brief description] (Priority: X/10)
2. **[Advantage 2]** - [Brief description] (Priority: X/10)  
3. **[Advantage 3]** - [Brief description] (Priority: X/10)

## Key Market Opportunities
- **[Opportunity 1]** - [Gap description]
- **[Opportunity 2]** - [Gap description]
- **[Opportunity 3]** - [Gap description]

## 6-Month Performance Targets
- **[Primary KPI]**: [Target improvement]
- **[Secondary KPI]**: [Target improvement]
- **[Platform Goal]**: [Specific target]
```

### Section 2: Testing Hypothesis Library (2-3 pages max)
**Format**: 8-12 specific hypotheses using this template:

```markdown
#### Hypothesis [#]: [Test Name]
**Research Basis**: [What client data supports this]
**Competitive Context**: [How competitors are weak here]
**Client Advantage**: [What unique strength this leverages]
**Test Prediction**: [Specific improvement expectation]
**Implementation**:
- Control: [Current approach]
- Test Variant 1: [Primary test approach]
- Test Variant 2: [Alternative approach]
**Success Metrics**: [Specific KPIs and targets]
**Timeline**: [Duration needed]
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low (X/10)
```

### Section 3: Testing Priority Matrix (1 page max)
```markdown
| Test Category | Impact Score | Priority | Month |
|---------------|--------------|----------|--------|
| [Test 1] | X/10 | HIGH | 1 |
| [Test 2] | X/10 | HIGH | 1 |
| [Test 3] | X/10 | MEDIUM | 2 |
```

## Analysis Requirements

### Focus Only On:
1. **3-5 Top Competitive Advantages** with priority scores
2. **8-12 Specific Testing Hypotheses** with implementation details
3. **Priority Matrix** showing which tests to run when
4. **6-Month Performance Targets** (3-4 key metrics only)

### Do NOT Include:
- ❌ Extended strategic analysis sections
- ❌ Detailed competitive landscape descriptions
- ❌ Month-by-month implementation timelines
- ❌ Risk management frameworks
- ❌ Success validation protocols
- ❌ Learning integration systems
- ❌ Extensive background context

### Claude Code Instructions

#### Step 1: Extract Core Elements
From client research, identify:
- **Top 3-5 competitive advantages** (with priority scores 1-10)
- **Top 3-5 market gaps** competitors aren't addressing
- **Current account performance issues** that need testing solutions

#### Step 2: Generate Hypothesis Library
Create **8-12 hypotheses** that:
- Link specific client advantages to testable approaches
- Address identified market gaps
- Solve current account performance issues
- Include specific implementation details

#### Step 3: Create Priority Matrix
Score each test on:
- **Impact Potential** (1-10)
- **Implementation Feasibility** (1-10) 
- **Strategic Alignment** (1-10)
- **Assign to Month** (1-6)

## Quality Standards

### Output Must Be:
- **Under 5 pages total**
- **Implementation-ready** (specific campaign details)
- **Research-backed** (every test cites client data)
- **Prioritized** (clear testing sequence)

### Every Hypothesis Must Include:
- ✅ Specific research basis from client files
- ✅ Clear competitive context/gap
- ✅ Exact implementation approach (control vs variants)
- ✅ Measurable success criteria
- ✅ Priority score and timeline

---

**Target Output**: Focused strategic testing plan that can be immediately implemented without additional analysis or documentation.
