## Client Analysis Integration Points

### 1. Required Client Data Sources
Before framework application, Claude Code should analyze:

#### Business Intelligence Sources
- `03_business_intel/questionnaire.md` - Core business positioning and goals
- `03_business_intel/ai_insights/phase_*.md` - AI-generated strategic insights
- `02_market_research/claude_research/phase_outputs/` - Market analysis outputs
- `02_market_research/market_intelligence/` - Competitive intelligence data

#### Account Structure Analysis  
- `06_campaign_structure/google_ads_structure.md` - Current Google Ads setup
- `06_campaign_structure/meta_ads_structure.md` - Current Meta setup
- `05_historical_data/` - Performance history and trends

## Core Testing Principles

### 1. Hypothesis-Driven Testing with Client Context
- **Build hypotheses from client analysis**: Use competitive gaps and market insights
- **Example Process**: 
  1. Identify competitor weakness from research
  2. Form hypothesis: "Emphasizing [unique advantage] will outperform generic messaging"
  3. Create 3-5 variations testing the hypothesis
  4. Measure against client's specific KPIs

### 2. Client-Specific Testing Priority Matrix

#### Priority Scoring Framework
Rate each test category (1-10) based on:
- **Impact Potential**: Based on competitive analysis and market gaps
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Current account structure and resources
- **Strategic Alignment**: Alignment with Phase 4 positioning strategy
- **Competitive Advantage**: Uniqueness vs competitor approach

#### Tier 1: Maximum Impact Tests (Prioritize if scoring 8-10)
1. **Strategic Positioning Tests**
   - Test unique value propositions identified in research
   - Compare client positioning vs competitor approaches
   - Test messaging that addresses competitor weaknesses

2. **Market Gap Exploitation**
   - Test approaches that fill identified market gaps
   - Leverage underutilized platforms or audiences
   - Test innovative offers competitors aren't using

3. **Competitive Differentiation**
   - Test elements that clearly separate from competition
   - Emphasize unique capabilities or guarantees
   - Test messaging that directly counters competitor positioning

#### Tier 2: High Impact Tests (Prioritize if scoring 6-8)
4. **Account Structure Optimization**
   - Reorganize campaigns based on performance analysis
   - Test new campaign types based on goals and budget
   - Optimize bidding strategies for client's specific metrics

5. **Creative Strategy Evolution**
   - Test creative formats competitors aren't using effectively
   - Develop messaging angles from market research insights
   - Test visual styles that differentiate from competitive landscape

#### Tier 3: Refinement Tests (Prioritize if scoring 4-6)
6. **Copy and Asset Optimization**
   - Test headline variations based on positioning strategy
   - Optimize descriptions using market research language
   - Test ad extensions that highlight competitive advantages

### Hypothesis Generation from Client Research
**Template for Claude Code:**
```
Based on analysis of [client_name]:
- Competitive Gap Identified: [specific gap from research]
- Market Opportunity: [opportunity from Phase 3 analysis] 
- Client Advantage: [unique strength from questionnaire]
- Test Hypothesis: [specific, measurable hypothesis]
- Success Metric: [client-specific KPI from goals]
- Implementation Strategy: [specific test design]
```

## Performance Measurement Framework

### Client-Aligned KPIs
**Primary Metrics (from client questionnaire goals):**
- Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) - target from client budget analysis
- Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) - aligned with client lifetime value
- Conversion Rate - specific to client's industry benchmarks
- Revenue Attribution - using client's preferred attribution model

**Strategic Metrics (from positioning research):**
- Brand Differentiation Score - measured through unique campaign performance
- Competitive Advantage Realization - performance vs industry benchmarks
- Market Share Growth - measured through impression share and reach
- Positioning Effectiveness - measured through engagement and quality scores

### Testing-Specific Success Criteria
- **Statistical Significance**: 95% confidence minimum (adjustable for client volume)
- **Business Significance**: Must align with client's minimum improvement thresholds
- **Strategic Alignment**: Tests must support overall positioning strategy
- **Competitive Progress**: Measured improvement vs competitor benchmarks

## Advanced Client-Specific Strategies

### Industry-Specific Adaptations
**Claude Code should identify:**
- Industry-specific seasonality patterns from historical data
- Regulatory or compliance considerations from questionnaire
- Industry-standard attribution windows and measurement practices
- Competitive landscape dynamics specific to client's market

### Budget Optimization Strategy
**Based on Client Budget Analysis:**
- **High Budget (>$50k/month)**: 25-30% testing allocation across multiple platforms
- **Medium Budget ($10-50k/month)**: 20-25% testing, focus on highest-impact tests
- **Small Budget (<$10k/month)**: 15-20% testing, sequential rather than parallel tests

### Scaling Framework
**Growth Phase Recommendations:**
1. **Foundation Phase**: Establish winning elements and competitive advantages
2. **Expansion Phase**: Scale successful tests across platforms and audiences
3. **Optimization Phase**: Refine winning combinations for maximum efficiency
4. **Innovation Phase**: Test new competitive advantages and market opportunities
